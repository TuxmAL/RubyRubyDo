== Description

This is RubyRubyDo ready for you.

RubyRubyDo is a Ruby ToDo application, aiming to be used as a KDE plasmoid.
I really missed this feature on KDE and whay I found already was too overkill
(integration with nepomuk, web server on local machine!) or required to give
away your data on the web.
Currently is under development the desktop application in QT, as playground for
writing the plasmoid itself.
Aside that, I hope to create even a CLI interface and a web interface and, for
free, an API to manage ToDo lists of your own in your projects.

== Documentation
See ToDo::ToDo and ToDo::Task for the core todo list and task management.
More information will be posted here as I'll develop the QT app, plasmoid, CLI
and web interface.

== Examples
Basic usage:

  todo_list = ToDo::ToDo.new  
  task1 = ToDo::Task.new 'Buy the milk!', 1, Date.today 
  task2 = ToDo::Task.new 'Phone John for ticket!', 2, Date.today + 1
  task3 = ToDo::Task.new 'Clean the car', 3, Date.today - 7
  task4 = ToDo::Task.new 'Go fishing!', 5
  todo_list << task1 << task2 << task3 << task4
  todo_list.save

Check if a task is overdue:

  puts todo_list[3].overdue?

Mark a task as fulfilled:

  todo_list[1].done
  puts todo_list[1].fulfilled_date

Unmark a task as done:

  todo_list[1].undone
  puts todo_list[1].due_date

Retrieve a saved todo:
  todo_list = ToDo::ToDo.new
  todo_list.load
